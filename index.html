    <h2>Story of His LIFE</h2>
    <p>Elton is British. Duh. He was born in Middlesex, England in 1947 (I know, he's old AF! Long live the king!).  He is a self-taught pianist. So cool. He has had a legendary 
        musical career, and continues to perform live, even in his 70s. He has a husband and two children. For a more extensive biography (because I trust us fans are all pretty familiar with our boy's 
        life story and I don't want to clog up this dope fan page), please reference:
